Bykhovsky, \"Channel Simulator for Weak-Turbulence Free-Space Optical Communications,\" Appl. Opt. 54, 9055-9059 (2015).\r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to generate lognormal distributed values with approximately exponential auto-covariance function and is based on a solution of first order stochastic differential equation (SDE). The provided code produces an example of such values, including probability density function (PDF) and auto-correlation function (ACF).\r\nThis code includes two Matlab files:\r\n\r\na) logn_sde.m – this file runs without any dependencies.\r\n\r\nb) logn_sde2.m – this time the same code uses the numerical solution provided by “A Matlab Toolbox for the Numerical Solution of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs)” from https://github.com/horchler/SDETools.\r\n\r\nThis code includes one Mathematica file (v. 10+) with similar functionality.\r\n\r\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY AUTHORS \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
